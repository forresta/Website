    <h1>This is a Jump Game that we made. We made functions for jumping, moving forward, and moving backward. 
	    We also had a boulder that moves to the left. If you touch the boulder, you will lose.
	    You have to jump over the boulder to reach the end. Once you do, it will tell you that you win. 
	    If you press r and enter, you can reset and play again. </h1>

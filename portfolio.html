		  <h1> This is our Rover Phone Home Project. We had a column of data and had to split it into four columns. We then had to guess which columns represented the four sensors of a rover. It had sensors for temperature, sounds, winds, and light. We then compared our data with that of different environments and came to the conclusion that it was in the Desert Plains.</h1>
